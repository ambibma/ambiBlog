# Ambi Blog


## About

A development of a personal blog using MERN stack (Mongo DB, Express, React and Node). I wanted to start blogging my dev experiences and projects I am working on but many free blog sights were clunky and too frustrating to use. So I decided to build my own.


## To Do
  * ~~Create Post functionality~~
    * ~~Implementing a text editor~~ 
  * ~~fetching posts from DB~~
  * ~~Creating a post detail page~~
  * ~~Edit post~~
  * ~~delete post~~
  * Securing myself as the only one able to create posts
  * Figuring out how to host it somewhere.... hmmmm
