# Ambi's Blog


## About

A development of a personal blog using MERN stack (Mongo DB, Express, React and Node). I wanted to start blogging my dev experiences and projects I am working on but many free blog sights were clunky and too frustrating to use. So I decided to build my own.


## Technologies Used

* React.Js
* MongoDB
* Express
* Node.js
* ReactQuill
* EmailJs
* CSS


## Description

This website consumes data via restfulAPI written in NodeJs to MongoDB services to call, fetch, delete , create and update blog posts. Data is rendered through components build in React on the front end. Ambi's Blog also utilizes JWT authentication to create administrators to limit who has access to create and manipulate data.  


## Known Bugs

* Logout functionality crashes when viewing a post's details


## To Do
  * ~~Create Post functionality~~
    * ~~Implementing a text editor~~ 
  * ~~fetching posts from DB~~
  * ~~Creating a post detail page~~
  * ~~Edit post~~
  * ~~delete post~~
  * ~~Securing myself as the only one able to create posts~~
  * ~~Figuring out how to host it somewhere.... hmmmm~~

  * ~~Create about page, with projects, posts and contact~~ [DONE!]

  * fun new objects to tinker with
